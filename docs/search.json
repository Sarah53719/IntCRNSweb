    "text": "Reversible A network or graph is reversible if y’ -&gt; y is a reaction whenever y -&gt; y’ is a reaction\nWeakly reversible if every reaction is part of an oriented cycle ie. each connected component of the graph is strongly connected\n\nWhen the underlying graph is weakly revesible, we will see that the solutions of the mass-action system are conjectured to have many important properties. Such as: - existence of positive steady states for all parameter values, persistence, permanence, and if the network satisfies some additional assumptions, also global stability\nAccording to Horn-Jackson theorem below, a complex-balanced system has a unique steady state within each stoichiometric compatability class and it is locally stable within it.\nOf all positive steady states we call attention to 2 kinds: these are characterised by the flux of a state xo (the valyes k (y-&gt;y’) xo^y of the reaction rate evaluated at xo)\n\nDetailed-balanced steady state a state xo is this if the network is reversible and every forward flux is balanced by the backward\n\nif a network is not reversible, then it cannot admit a detailed-balanced steady state. - the fluxes across pairs of reversible reactions ate balanced in a detailed- balanced steady state hence xo is also called an edge-balanced steady state.\n\nComplex-balanced steady state if at each vertex of the graph, the flux flowing into the vertex balance the fluxes flowing out of the vertex at that state\n\nif the network is not weakly reversible then it cannot admit a complex-balanced steady state. - At a complex-balanced steady state x0, the net flux through any vertex is zero; hence x0 is also called a vertex-balanced steady state.\nCOMPLEX BALANCE IS A GENRALIZATION OF DETAILED BALANCE SO if the state x0 is detailed-balanced, then it is complex balanced\nT",
