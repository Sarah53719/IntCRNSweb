Deficiency zero theorem = a mass-action system if complex balanced for all values of its reaction rate constant iff it’s weakly reversible and has deficiency zero"

In this we are gonna go through definition of Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNS) and apply it to mass action kinetics. Then show different theorems like xero deficiency and weakly reverible to help show type of stability. Next we will look at bifurcation and explain with different examples. After there are some practise examples of different crn example with diagrams.",
