Law of mass action = The rate at which a reaction occurs is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant species.

Despite this simple formulation, mass-action systems are known which exhibit varied and exotic behaviour,
including stability, multistability, switching behaviour, finite escape time, oscillations, limit cycles,
chaotic behaviour, and Hopf bifurcations.
