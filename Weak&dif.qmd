deficiency = a non-negative integer associated to a reaction network measure of how far a weakly
reversible system is for being complex-balanced. so zero deficiency theorem refers to the codimension
zero case (case where the mass-action system is complex-balanced for all k)
deficiency of the network is the non-negative integer = m l s where: m nodes and l connected
components and the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is s.
Deficiency zero theorem = a mass-action system if complex balanced for all values of its reaction
rate constant iff itâ€™s weakly reversible and has deficiency zero
