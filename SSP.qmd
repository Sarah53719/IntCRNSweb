## Differentiability

A function $\fb:\Real^n\to\Real^m$ is **differentiable** at $\xb\in\Real^n$ if there exists an $m\times n$ matrix $M$ and a map $\Rb:\Real^n\to\Real^m$ such that
$$
\fb(\xb + \hb) = \fb(\xb) + M\hb + \Rb(\hb) \quad \textrm{for all $\hb\in\Real^n$}
$$
and
$$
\lim_{\hb\to\bfzero}\frac{\Rb(\hb)}{|\hb|} = \bfzero.
$$

:::{.callout-note}
This definition says that $\fb$ looks locally like a linear map. The second condition ensures that the nonlinear **remainder** $\Rb(\hb)$ goes to zero faster than linear, as you look closer and closer to $\xb$.

If $M$ exists then it is called the (**total**) **derivative** of $\fb$.
