Chemical reaction network (CRN) is a framework for modeling the evolution of chemical concentrations reuslting from simulating occuring chemical reactions

CRN is given by sets of chemical species which react to form different sets of species.

Defined by N = (S, C, R) where S id the species set, C is the complex st and R is the reaction set.
Contains 3 finite non-empty sets

CRN - chemical reaction network = often modelled under the assumption of mass action kinetics by a system of ODEs with polynomial right-hadn sides that describe the time evolution of concentrations of chemcial species involved.

a collection (S = chemical species, C reaction complexes, R chemical reactions)


CRNs can be regarded as Euclidean embedded graph and so can be represented as a directed graph G(V, E),
 which keeps track of the connections between the nodes of the graph.
