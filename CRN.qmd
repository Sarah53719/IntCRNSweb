Chemical reaction network (CRN) is a framework for modeling the evolution of chemical concentrations reuslting from simulating occuring chemical reactions
CRN is given by sets of chemical species which react to form different sets of species.

Defined by N = (S, C, R) where S id the species set, C is the complex st and R is the reaction set.

CRNs can be regarded as Euclidean embedded graph and so can be represented as a directed graph G(V, E),
 which keeps track of the connections between the nodes of the graph.
